In an effort to streamline both the collecting and organizing of our resources library, and prevent 404 pages due to broken links, we have devised the following two-stage process.

# Stage 1 - **Current Stage**

## *Main focus - Collecting all the resources and having them in one place.*

* Add the resources posted by Beluga members into the main readme.md file **only**. 
* We will have tentative categories that will be revised at a later stage. 
* If you do not see an appropriate category, you can create it in the readme.md file.
* Please do not add new folders, and do not add to the existing files. 

#Stage 2 

## *Main focus - Organization*
We are still using trello to brainstorm additional categories.  If you have ideas or suggestions you are invited to share them there, also.  

## *Thank You Everyone*
We are very thankful to everyone who has taken the time to share their favorite links, as well as everyone who is participating in the maintaining the resource library repo!

* Contribution guidelines will be added once we reach this stage
